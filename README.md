# SimpleFTP
This is a simplified version of the FTP application protocol, consisting of two separate programs: an FTP client and an FTP server.

## Server
The FTP server is responsible for maintaining FTP sessions and providing file access. 

## Client
The FTP client is split into two components: an FTP user interface and an FTP client to make requests to the FTP server. The client provides a simple user interface with a command prompt asking the user to input a command that will be issued to the FTP server.
